Description: A set of scripts for checking out and tracking a mercurial project
from git. Push supported added as well although it is still experimental.

* Dependencies *

Mercurial (hg) and python must be installed and in your $PATH.

If this is a fresh checkout run

  $ git submodule update --init

to pull in fast-export. If for some reason you cannot do this
get a copy of fast-export from http://repo.or.cz/w/fast-export.git and
place it in the root of the checkout.

* Installation *

Either add /path/to/this/checkout/bin to your $PATH, or symbolic link
/path/to/this/checkout/bin/git-hg into a directory on your $PATH.

* Usage *

- clone an hg repo, including ones over HTTP

  $ git-hg clone http://some/random/hg/repo [local-git-repo-name]

- fetch updates from the hg repo

  $ git-hg fetch

  or optionally

  $ git-hg pull # same as git-hg-fetch && git merge hg/branch_name

- checkout a new branch from hg

  $ git-hg checkout branch_name

* Structure *

.git/hgcheckout - contains a bare mercurial checkout of the specified repo

.git/hgremote   - contains a bare git repo clones from the mercurial one, this
                  is added as a remote called "hg" in the base repo
